# DinoBloom: A Foundation Model for Generalizable Cell Embeddings in Hematology

[Original](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193)

PyTorch implementation and pretrained models for DINOv2. For details, see the papers: **[DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193)** and **[Vision Transformers Need Registers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16588)**.

DINOv2 models produce high-performance visual features that can be directly employed with classifiers as simple as linear layers on a variety of computer vision tasks; these visual features are robust and perform well across domains without any requirement for fine-tuning. The models were pretrained on a dataset of 142 M images without using any labels or annotations.
